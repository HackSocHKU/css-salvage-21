# CSS Salvage, Hacklympics 2021

## Details
*Time*: 5-6:30 PM HKT, 27th Feb 2021

*Location*: Discord

*Submission Link*: https://forms.gle/5PbiFGXodYhypx126

## Requirements
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to transform this HTML webpage into an appealing and user-friendly site, using your design and styling skills.
Keep in mind the following pointers:
* The current webpage is hard to read. Make the page **more navigable** so that one can find content more easily
* Using **visual cues**, such as images and other graphical art, is encouraged since the page is currently very text-heavy
* The HTML file is just a starting point, and you are **free to transform the page** according to your own vision
* Make the page look more **stylised and modern**
* Finally, you must **submit only one file** (i.e. the modified HTML document) to us. All scripting and styling must be done inside the document, use inline and internal styling &
scripting for the same. [Here is a quick guide on internal and in-line styling](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp#midcontentadcontainer).

## Rules
There is only one rule, **do not remove or alter the content of existing HTML elements**. You are free to use CSS and scripting on these elements, but the content must not be modified. 

Feel free to add <div> tags wherever you find them necessary, we havenâ€™t provided any for more flexibility. You are welcome to add more content and other components anywhere in the document. Use of CSS, JavaScript and other styling libraries (e.g. Bootstrap) is accepted

## Submission
You must submit your HTML file through a [Google Form](https://forms.gle/5PbiFGXodYhypx126). Remember, this competition is on an individual basis, so each participant can submit one entry. Please name your file **NameSurname.html** (e.g. JohnSmith.html) for easy identification of your work.
Keep in mind that you can only submit **ONE HTML FILE**, so make sure to keep all your scripting and styling inside the HTML file.

* Use of visual cues like images, graphics and videos (15%)
