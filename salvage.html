    <h1><a name="what"></a>What</h1>
    <p>
      According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, a smart city is an urban area that uses different types of electronic methods and sensors to collect data. Insights gained from that data are used to manage assets, resources and services efficiently; in return, that data is used to improve the operations across the city. <br>
      The concept of a Smart City, however, can be much broader and "sci-fi"! What is very interesting is that this term has been around for over 25 years and therefore continued to evolve with the advent of technology. In general, a smart city is a city that uses technology to provide services and solve city problems. A smart city does things like improve transportation and accessibility, improve social services, promote sustainability, and give its citizens a voice. The main goals of a smart city are to improve policy efficiency, reduce waste and inconvenience, improve social and economic quality, and maximize social inclusion.

    <h3>Fundamental principles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Network Connectivity</li>
      <li>Effective Mobility</li>
      <li>Cyber Resilience</li>
      <li>Citizen Engagement</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><a name="why"></a>Why</h1>
    <p>
      Smart city technology can make cities more effective and efficient, which is necessary given the projected rapid growth in urban populations over the next few decades. As a result, investments in smart city technology in North America are expected to increase from $118.5 billion in 2016 to $244.5 billion in 2021, according to BCC Research. About two-thirds of cities have already invested in smart city technology, and many others are eyeing implementation. Increased federal funding and strong partnerships with city governments and private sector technology firms will further cement the reality of smart cities. <br>
      The 5 biggest motivators for investors:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Data driven decision making</li>
      <li>Engagement between citizens and governments</li>
      <li>Safer communities</li>
      <li>Improved transportation</li>
      <li>Reduced carbon footprint</li>
    </ol>
    <h1><a name="how"></a>How & Where</h1>
    <h3>Athens, Greece</h3>
    <p>
      Athens went into their smart city endeavors with the mindset that, “A smart city is more than a sum of platforms and investments and tools. It’s about how we’re going to transform our cities and change our cities. It’s about change.”
      They started out with a solid structure, which included creating a tool kit and a digital roadmap and setting a position for a Chief Digital Officer. 
      Athens city leaders realized that they couldn’t solve all the city problems alone. They formed partnerships with the private sector and universities and enlisted their help in finding and implementing solutions.
      They created a living strategy document for 2018. “It was not ambitious or revolutionary, but we did it,” says Konstantinos. The strategy focused on solving real problems that real citizens face, including investing in infrastructure and the government, boosting digital skills of the elderly and unemployed, delivering and coordinating support for refugees, and boosting engagement with citizens by creating online platforms.
      The city used its private sector and university partnerships to boost trust in the government. Citizens wouldn’t have trusted digital skills courses run by the city, so they invited big tech companies and universities to deliver these courses for free. As people saw that the city could create partnerships and solve their problems, trust grew.

    <h3>Chennai, India</h3>
    <p>
      The city of Chennai, India is experiencing many challenges, but it is tackling these problems one by one using smart city solutions. The list of challenges likely sounds familiar to any city leader: a large population of 8 million, congestion from private cars, poor infrastructure, pollution. Raj Cherubal, Director at Chennai City Connect, gives several examples of the smart city projects underway in Chennai that are aimed at solving these problems:
      Improving the livability of the city by adding public spaces, despite opposition that adding public space may destroy business and be the end of the city.  Chennai is looking to create its own version of Times Square.
      Promoting the use of German GPS-enabled bikes to cut down on private cars on the roads. Although people in a developing country may see bicycles as a step backward (when wealth is growing, and one may finally be able to afford a personal car), the city has helped adoption rates by glamorizing these fancy bikes that can be tracked and booked in advance.
      Adding infrastructure underground throughout the city. This is difficult because there is not much data on where water pipes are, so Chennai is working on GIS mapping and advanced tunneling technology.
      Creating the largest parking management system in the country, if not the world. This camera-based system will be able to recognize empty parking spots on the road; then citizens can use an app to reserve their parking spot in advance.
      Setting up smart classrooms. The city has partnered with Samsung to put smart technology in the classrooms. As Raj puts it, this is “the tip of the iceberg” in terms of all the things they may be able to do to make classrooms smarter.
      Restoring 3,000 bodies of water, some simple and some complex. This project includes the use of drones that can land on the water’s surface, take a sample, analyze it, and send real-time information on pollution levels.

    <h3>Prague, Czech Republic</h3>
    <p>
      The Czech Republic is a country with 10 million people located in central Europe. The capital, Prague, is the largest city in the country and contributes about 30 percent of the economy of the state. Prague faces many of the same challenges experienced by other cities. The city is growing, and those who want to live in the city expect a comfortable life, placing high expectations on everything from housing and transportation to waste management and energy. In Prague, smart city projects are tackled by a separate company that is owned by the state. Here, Pavel Tesar, a representative from that company, discusses how the arrangement works and some of the projects they have worked on.
      The state-owned company was established to fulfill the IT and smart city needs of Prague. The advantage is that the company is able to quickly and efficiently work on city requests and doesn’t experience budget problems. On the other hand, Pavel says that getting approvals can be difficult because sometimes city organizations don’t cooperate well, and the company itself doesn’t have a direct decision-making role. 
      The company has created a policy that internally they call Pipeline. This process management policy helps because it guides ideas to fruition.
      The city is currently running 60 projects, some of which have finished and others which are brand new. The work is handled by a group of 120 employees.
      The company brings in stakeholders to assist with projects. This includes the economic sphere and also academia. They don’t consider themselves to be the ‘best brains,’ but know that through working with stakeholders, they can have access to the brightest minds in and outside of the country.
      The strategy for smart city projects is divided into five areas—mobility, smart buildings, waste-free city, people in the urban environment, and tourism. A sixth area is the data platform, which is the flagship project.
      Projects include the previously mentioned data platform, as well as sensor projects to analyze traffic and the environment, a regional transportation ticketing system, and energy monitoring/savings.
